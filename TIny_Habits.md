### Tiny Habits
## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg
* The idea of flossing just one tooth really stood out to me because it showed how even a tiny action can start a real habit.
* It made me realise that we don’t need big motivation to change; we just need something so small and easy that we can’t fail.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message
* B = MAP means Behaviour happens when Motivation, Ability and a Prompt come together.
* M is Motivation, A is Ability and P is Prompt.
* To make new habits easier, choose a very tiny habit so your ability is high.
* Use a clear prompt (like something you already do) to remind you.
* Don’t wait for motivation because it changes.
* Keep the habit small and consistent so it becomes automatic.

## Question 3
* Celebration creates a positive feeling in the brain right after doing the habit.
* This positive emotion helps the brain remember the action and repeat it.
* When we celebrate, the habit gets reinforced and becomes easier to do next time.
* Whatever we celebrate grows stronger, so small celebrations help tiny habits become automatic.

## Question 4
* The most interesting idea for me was the concept of getting 1% better every day instead of trying to make big changes all at once.
* I liked the example of “marginal gains,” where making tiny improvements in many small areas leads to huge results over time.
* It showed me that small progress, done consistently, can create a big difference in the long run.

  ## Question 5
* The book says real habit change starts with identity, not goals.
* Instead of “What do I want to achieve?”, we should ask “Who do I want to become?”.
* Every small habit we do is a vote for the kind of person we want to be.
* When our identity matches our habits, change becomes easier and more natural.

  ## Question 6
* The book says that to make a habit easier, we must reduce friction and remove anything that makes the habit hard.
* Break the habit into a smaller, simpler version so it takes less effort to start.
* Change your environment to support the habit, like keeping things visible and easy to reach.
* Make the habit so convenient that you can do it even on days when you feel low or unmotivated.

## Question 7
* The book says to make a bad habit harder, you should increase friction around it.
* Add small obstacles that slow you down or make the habit less convenient.
* Change your environment so the habit is out of sight and hard to reach.
* The more steps and effort it takes to do the habit, the less likely you are to continue it.

## Question 8
* I want to practice coding for 15 minutes every day.
* I will keep my laptop and coding files easily accessible so the cue is obvious.
* I will code for 15 minutes right after I reach home from the office.
* I will start with simple or interesting problems to make the habit attractive.
* I will keep it easy by doing just one small problem or one small concept.
* I will remove friction by keeping my IDE, notes, and links ready beforehand.
* I will make it satisfying by tracking my streak or celebrating after I complete the session.

## Question 9
* I want to reduce my habit of scrolling on my phone for long hours.
* I will make the cue invisible by keeping my phone in another room when I reach home.
* I will turn off unnecessary notifications so I don’t get tempted.
* I will make the habit unattractive by reminding myself how much time I lose.
* I will make it harder by logging out of apps or keeping the phone on silent.
* I will make the response unsatisfying by setting a rule: if I scroll too much, I have to skip something I enjoy.
