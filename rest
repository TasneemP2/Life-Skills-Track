# Rest Architecture

## What is Rest?
REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style used for designing network-based applications,
especially web services. It defines a set of rules and constraints that allow systems to communicate over the internet in a simple, scalable, and lightweight way.
During the development phase, API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.x

## Architectural Properties
REST is based on the idea that everything is a resource, and each resource is identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). 
The client interacts with the server by sending HTTP requests, and the server returns a representation of the resource (usually in JSON or XML format).
